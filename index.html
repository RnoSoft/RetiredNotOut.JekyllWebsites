<p>Sometime ago I wrote <a href="https://ulverstonfallen.uk">Ulverston Fallen</a> for my cousin. It taught me a lot about writing websites: how to get them to display in a browser, fast; how to make them responsive, viewable on a mobile phone and a large screen connected to a workstation; and how they are coded (the HTML, CSS and Java Script). The problem is, I used Microsoft’s Asp.Net Core software and the C# programming language, great for me, but very difficult for the average website developer.</p>

<p>Soon after I wrote the website, I started looking for alternative ways to write static websites and came across markdown and static website generators.</p>

<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to write the content for a website page. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/">here</a>. I quickly decided that markdown was the way to go, most people should be able to use it.</p>

<p>I also came across static website generators. The first one I tried was Hugo, which I quickly eliminated as it uses go (an awful programming language in my opinion) for creating templates and themes. I finally settled on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which uses <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid">shopify’s liquid</a> templating language (much, much better).</p>

<p>I’ve used the combination to write this, and my <a href="https://retirednotout.uk">personal website</a>. I’m also using them to rewrite <a href="https://ulverstonfallen.uk">Ulverston Fallen</a>.</p>

<p>This website contains many articles about what I’ve learnt, and how I wrote the websites. Some of them describe open-source software I have written, to help you write your website.</p>

<p>This and my personal website use the same theme. When it’s completed I aim to make it open-source. There is more information about how I arrived at this design, <a href="/themes/designing-a-simple-jekyll-theme">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-a-website">The Cost of a Website</h2>

<p>Often, people or communities that want a website have a very limited budget. By using open-source software, the cost of writing a website can be low or even free. By using GitHub pages to host your website, it can be hosted for free. However, there can be other costs. Ulverston Fallen needed a map of Ulverston, that had to be purchased. Websites might need photographs, which will have to be purchased. (<em>It’s important to note that you cannot use photos from other sites without permission. You cannot use the photos on my websites, without my permission</em>).</p>

<p>The one cost you cannot get away from is your domain name. My websites and Ulverston Fallen use ‘.uk’ domain names, these cost us around £10 a year, though the usual cost is £12/14. A ‘.com’ will cost you much more, but do you really need a ‘.com’? There is more about choosing and setting up domain names <a href="/domain-names/choosing-and-setting-up-a-domain-name">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot write one yourself, a major cost will be your Jekyll theme. I’m lucky, I’m able to write my own, so there is no cost. But, they are difficult to write, way beyond most people. Once I’ve completed it, you can use this theme for free. There are many Jekyll Theme’s available on the internet, some are free and some cost money. One of those might suit you. If you want a bespoke theme, it might cost you a lot of money. Good, experienced website designers are not cheap. However, once you have a theme, you will be able to write your own content.</p>

<p>By using open-source software, the three websites I am currently working on, have been written for free, and are hosted for free. This is very important to me. I’ve managed this by using the following open-source software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll Static Website Generator</a> to develop my themes and write the content (release 4.3.3 and above).</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> to prepare my photographs (release 2.10.36 and above).</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a> to manipulate maps (release 3.34 and above).</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> to display and manipulate maps in the browser (release 1.9.4 and above).</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to write my themes and website content (release 1.89.0 and above).</li>
</ul>

<p>The websites are hosted for free with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<h2 id="this-websites-layout">This Website’s Layout</h2>

<p>This website contains many articles about writing websites based on the Jekyll static website generator, they are all listed <a href="/articles/">here</a>. Each one has one or more categories, which are listed on the <a href="/categories/">categories</a> page. Clicking a category on the categories page displays a list of the articles for that category.</p>
