<p><span class="provisional"><strong><em>This article is provisional.</em></strong></span></p>

<p>This article is about the design of this website’s theme.</p>

<p>The look and feel of a website is very important, it must look good on a mobile phone and on a large monitor. Nowadays we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive web design</a>. We design for the smallest device, usually a mobile phone, and then progressively enhance the design as the screen size increases.</p>

<p>The one thing I am not (and never want to be) is an expert website designer or programmer. I know the basics and that’s enough for me. This is the main reason this design is so simple. But I also prefer uncluttered websites, I don’t want to have to wade through loads of pointless information to get to the article/blog post I want to read.</p>

<p>I also want to be able see what someone else is writing about. Often, I’ll find an interesting blog post, and think, what else has this person written about. If you’re lucky there is a list of blog posts, if there are only a few, then fine. If there are hundreds, then I’m not going to bother exploring them. Some people tag their posts, and with luck there is a list of posts for each tag (this is good).</p>

<p>This is something I want to explore with this theme, presenting information to the reader, and making it simple for the reader to find out what I am writing about.</p>

<h2 id="blog-posts-articles-and-categories">Blog Posts, Articles and Categories</h2>

<p>Initially, this theme was going to be a blog, a list of posts that could be listed in reverse date order. Each post was going to be tagged, so there would be a list of posts for each tag, again, in reverse date order.</p>

<p>However, there was a problem with this approach, this page <a href="https://retirednotout.uk/family/trips-2007-to-2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Trips 2007 to 2012</a> started off as five individual posts. They where linked by the tag of familly, and that was all.</p>

<h2 id="articles-and-categories">Articles and Categories</h2>

<p>The initial version of the website was going to have a blog</p>

<h2 id="sidebars">Sidebars</h2>

<p>The one thing I have decided not to have is sidebars (also known as asides). Sidebars can be very useful, but they cannot be displayed on a mobile phone, the screen is just not wide enough. So I’ve decided to just not have them.</p>

<h2 id="header">Header</h2>

<p>The header is at the top of website, the first thing that is displayed.</p>

<p>It is very simple, it’s just a landscape photograph (that can be easily changed), with a title overlayed on it. Initially, I wasn’t going to have a photo at the top, but I quickly reached the conclusion that a photograph is good. Especially as I’m a photographer. It always scales to fit 100% of the width, and the height scales proportionally. The greater the height of the original, the greater the area of the screen that is used. So long, thin photos are good.</p>

<p>I want to make this theme open source, so that anyone can use it. The initial version will only have one type of header. Overtime I would like to have many different types of headers, you just select the one that best suites you. But they will always be simple, so they are easy for me to program.</p>

<p>The text that is displayed on the photo can be easily changed. But in the initial version it will always be white and located at the centre bottom of the photo. This means the bottom area of the photo cannot be white. In an early version it was top, left. One of my header photos has a white sky so the title was difficult to see. For now, I’ve simple assumed that the bottom of the photo is never white, or nearly white.</p>

<h2 id="menu">Menu</h2>

<p>This is where it gets difficule. On a large screen you can have lots</p>
