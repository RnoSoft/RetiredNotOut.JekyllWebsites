<p><span class="provisional"><strong><em>This article is very provisional</em></strong></span></p>

<p>Often, people or communities that want a website have a very limited budget. By using open-source software, the cost of writing a website can be low or even free. By using GitHub pages to host your website, it can be hosted for free. However, there can be other costs. Ulverston Fallen needed a map of Ulverston, that had to be purchased. Websites might need photographs, which will have to be purchased. (<em>It’s important to note that you cannot use photos from other sites without permission. You cannot use the photos on my websites, without my permission</em>).</p>

<p>The one cost you cannot get away from is your domain name. My websites and Ulverston Fallen use ‘.uk’ domain names, these cost us around £10 a year, though the usual cost is £12/14. A ‘.com’ will cost you much more, but do you really need a ‘.com’? There is more about choosing and setting up domain names <a href="/domain-names/choosing-and-setting-up-a-domain-name">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot write one yourself, a major cost will be your Jekyll theme. I’m lucky, I’m able to write my own, so there is no cost. But, they are difficult to write, way beyond most people. Once I’ve completed it, you can use this theme for free. There are many Jekyll Theme’s available on the internet, some are free and some cost money. One of those might suit you. If you want a bespoke theme, it might cost you a lot of money. Good, experienced website designers are not cheap. However, once you have a theme, you will be able to write your own content.</p>

<p>By using open-source software, the three websites I am currently working on, have been written for free, and are hosted for free. This is very important to me. I’ve managed this by using the following open-source software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll Static Website Generator</a> to develop my themes and write the content (release 4.3.3 and above).</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> to prepare my photographs (release 2.10.36 and above).</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a> to manipulate maps (release 3.34 and above).</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> to display and manipulate maps in the browser (release 1.9.4 and above).</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to write my themes and website content (release 1.89.0 and above).</li>
</ul>

<p>The websites are hosted for free with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
