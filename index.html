<p><img class="float-image-left" src="/content/index/paul.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell" /></p>

<p>This is the personal website of Paul Chappell. I’m a 69-year-old retired computer programmer, living in West Yorkshire, England.</p>

<p>I’ll be writing about anything that interests me, absolutely anything (except programming, which I’ll write about <a href="https://jekyllwebsites.retirednotout.uk">here</a>, I don’t want to put people off!). However, my main interests are as follows. These are the subjects I’ll be writing about most.</p>

<h3 id="photography">Photography</h3>

<p>I’ve been a keen photographer all my life.</p>

<p>It all started when I was at university in the mid-seventies. In those days there were no digital cameras, it was all film. In my study, I have a large box of slides and prints. I’m hoping to digitise some of them, in order to show them on this website (though there are issues doing this, see <a href="/photography/digitising-old-slides-negatives-and-prints">this web page</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007 I bought a digital SLR (a Canon EOS400D). It’s getting very old now, but it still works. I’m hoping to replace it later this year. I also use my mobile phone. For photo editing I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, it’s open source and free.</p>

<p>I’ll be publishing a lot of my photographs on this website. <em>You are not allowed to use any of them without my written permission, see my <a href="/copyright">copyright page</a> for further information.</em></p>

<p><img class="float-image-right" src="/content/index/paul-edge-hill.jpg" alt="Paul Chappell at Edge Hill Station in 1977" /></p>

<p>The photograph of me on the right was taken by my friend John Buckley at Edge Hill railway station, in 1977.</p>

<h3 id="science-and-technology">Science and Technology</h3>

<p>I’ve always been interested in science, maths and engineering.</p>

<p>Back in the early/mid-seventies I did a civil engineering degree. I never became a civil engineer; I decided computer programming was much more interesting. The one thing I did learn on the course was how buildings are designed and built. For some reason, I’ve always loved big bridges.</p>

<p>The course taught me a lot about maths, most of it I’ve forgotten, but I really liked maths (well, someone has to).</p>

<p>I may write about computers and the internet on this website, but not about programming (I don’t want to put people off). I’ve another website dedicated to programming websites, it’s <a href="http://jekyllwebsites.retirednotout.uk/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>

<p>I’ve been lucky to travel abroad a lot in the past, but nowadays its mostly local. Around West Yorkshire and Merseyside. I’ll be writing about my travels.</p>

<p>I’ve been a member of the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">Campaign for Real Ale</a> for over 50 years! I’ll be writing about some of the more interesting pubs I visit. Like the <a href="https://theshipandmitre.uk/">Ship and Mitre</a> Liverpool, one of my favourites.</p>

<h2 id="website-layout">Website Layout</h2>

<p>This website is still under development, at this point in time I have no idea of what its final form will be. One of the reasons I’m writing it, is to learn more about the design and programming of small websites. As I learn more, the layout of the website will almost certainly change. I’ll be writing about this on another website, <a href="http://jekyllwebsites.retirednotout.uk/">located here</a>.</p>

<p>This layout is article based. The <a href="/articles">articles</a> page lists all the articles I have written. Each one has one or more categories, which are listed on the <a href="/categories">categories</a> page. Clicking a category on the categories page displays a page listing all the articles for that category.</p>
