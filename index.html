<p>Sometime ago I wrote <a href="https://ulverstonfallen.uk">Ulverston Fallen</a> for my cousin. It taught me a lot about writing websites: how to get them to display in a browser, fast; how to make them responsive, viewable on a mobile phone and a large screen connected to a workstation; and how they are coded (the HTML, CSS and Java Script). The problem is, I used Microsoft’s Asp.Net Core software and the C# programming language, great for me, but very difficult for the average website developer.</p>

<p>Soon after I wrote the website, I started looking for alternative ways to write static websites and came across markdown and static website generators.</p>

<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to write the content for a website page. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/">here</a>. I quickly decided that markdown was the way to go, most people should be able to use it.</p>

<p>I also came across static website generators. The first one I tried was Hugo, which I quickly eliminated as it uses go (an awful programming language in my opinion) for creating templates and themes. I finally settled on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which uses <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid">shopify’s liquid</a> templating language (much, much better).</p>

<p>I’ve used the combination to write this, and my <a href="https://retirednotout.uk">personal website</a>. I’m also using them to rewrite <a href="https://ulverstonfallen.uk">Ulverston Fallen</a>.</p>

<p>This website contains many articles about what I’ve learnt, and how I wrote the websites. Some of them describe open-source software I have written, to help you write your website.</p>

<p>This and my personal website use the same theme. When it’s completed, I will be making it open source, so anyone can use it. There is more information about how I arrived at this design, <a href="/web-sites/designing-a-simple-jekyll-theme">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="this-websites-layout">This Website’s Layout</h2>

<p>This website contains many articles about writing websites based on the Jekyll static website generator, they are all listed <a href="/articles/">here</a>. Each one has one or more categories, which are listed on the <a href="/categories/">categories</a> page. Clicking a category on the categories page displays a list of the articles for that category.</p>
